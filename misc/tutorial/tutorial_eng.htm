  by Hubas
</h1>

<p class="testoBLACK">This
tutorials aim will be to explain how to use the very handy little program
called EasyGen. </p>
<p class="testoBLACK">Creating good terrain for Quake 3 or one of
its mods used to be a big hassle. First you had to draw a height map (which is
fairly easy to visualize IMO), then you had to write, or at least edit, a
number of shaders, which control how the textures blend on your terrain. Before
you were finished you would also have to draw something called an alpha map,
which controls how the terrain is texturized in quake. </p>
<p class="testoBLACK">Alpha maps
are, for me at least, very complicated to visualize. It would also be fairly
easy to make mistakes with the alpha map which produces ugly seams in the end
result. I think EasyGen’s greatest feature is that it allows you to paint your
alpha map directly on your terrain mesh. You can even choose to view the
terrain in texturized mode (blended exactly like the end result). When you are
done the program will export your terrain complete with shader scripts into the
appropriate folders. After that it’s just a matter of bringing it up in Radiant
and continue to add other structures such as houses etc.<br>
  </p>
<h2 class="testoWHITE"><span class="testoGREEN">. Setup</span></h2>
<p><span class="testoBLACK">Be sure of using EasyGenRC1 with at least the 'fixed_exe_b' (if it's not the case check the files section) or EasyGen v1.0.</span><br>
</p>
<h2 class="testoGREEN">. Creating the mesh</h2>

<p class="testoBLACK">There are several
ways to go about creating the terrain mesh.</p>
<p class="testoBLACK">1. Begin
from a height map created in Photoshop or another image editing program. If you
aim to create a terrain with 32 * 32 subdivisions you will need a height map
with dimensions 33*33 pixels. Every pixel corresponds to a vertex in your
height map. Dark pixels generate low areas, and bright pixels generate more
elevated areas. </p>
<p class="testoBLACK">When you
have saved your height map in Photoshop, alter the size of your terrain to the
desired one, click file -&gt; Import -&gt; Bitmap. You will be questioned about
grid height, which is preset to 256 units high, I usually alter this to 1024 to
make my terrain more alternating. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Image1.jpg"></p>

<p class="testoREDs"><span class="testoBLACK">Voila! We
have some terrain.</span></p>
<p class="testoREDs"><span class="testoBLACK">2. In grid
mode you can move vertexes up and down by holding down Ctrl+Shift+Lmouse over
the vertex you want to manipulate. Or you can enter modifier mode and apply
modifiers like hill or smooth etc. Hold down Ctrl to move your modifier around,
press apply when you are happy with the position. For more information about
the modifiers shortcuts look under the help dialog box.</span></p>

<h2 class="testoGREEN">. Creating the Alpamap</h2>

<p class="testoBLACK"> Now we want to select some textures and paint
our alpha map. Select Textures -&gt; Add folder to add the folder where you’ve
stored your terrain textures. After that select “Alphamap” on the window on the
left. Your screen should now look something like this. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Image2.jpg"></p>

<p class="testoBLACK">Notice the
Palette in the upper left corner. Click the upper left square and a colour
select tool should pop right up. After you have selected a colour for the
index, select a texture from the texture window below to assign it to the
colour. This is what my alpha map looks like now.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Image3.jpg"></p>

<p class="testoBLACK">After that
you can assign other textures to other colours. When you paint the mesh hold
down Ctrl+Shift+Lmouse and paint the colour directly on your mesh. After a
while it might look something like this. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Image4.jpg"></p>

<p class="testoBLACK">If a black
triangle shows up anywhere in the height map while in texture render mode, it means that you have tried to
blend more than two textures together over the same polygon, which q3 can’t
handle. </p>
<p class="testoBLACK">If you like
you can select the texture view mode in the view menu to get some kind of idea
of how it will look in game. If you think your textures looks too stretched or
too cramped you can alter their scale with Keypad + and Keypad -. </p>

<h2 class="testoGREEN">. Exporting</h2>

<p class="testoBLACK">Pressing
File -&gt; Export -&gt; Map will bring up a new dialog box which looks like
this. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Image5.jpg"></p>

<p class="testoBLACK">The most
important part of this dialog is the “Metashader options”, and the “Alphamap
options”. Filename is what your .shader file will be called. Name is what your
actual shader will be called (they can be different). Alphamap filename is
pretty self explanatory.</p>
<p class="testoBLACK">If you wish
you can set EasyGen to export your map complete with a skybox and an
info_player_start entity. You can also select some of the other cool effects
which can be seen in the Team Arena levels, such as Dust, Breath, and clouds.</p>
<p class="testoBLACK">We might
not have changed our map since our last export. We might just be interested in
exporting the shaders, and the alpha map in these cases. If that’s the case
just deselect the appropriate boxes up in the left corner. </p>
<p class="testoBLACK">Press
continue and select a name for your map. And you are ready to fire up radiant
and compile. It’s not harder than that.</p>
<p class="testoBLACK">Good luck</p>
